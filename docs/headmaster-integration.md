# Headmaster admin integration (Nora-rebranding)

This branch lets the signed-in Headmaster **Admin Panel** embed Nora's real
operator (`/app`) and platform-admin (`/admin`) surfaces inside one
Headmaster-hosted workspace, with a single sign-in and no routine second
login. Native Nora login remains fully functional as the protected
break-glass operator path during canary validation.

Status by layer:

| Layer | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Olive/lime theme, rebranded shells, preserved nav/attribution | implemented |
| App-owned frame policy (build-time parent origin) | implemented |
| Presentation/readiness bridge (origin+nonce checked) | implemented |
| Launch-code SSO exchange (S2S issue → browser redeem) | implemented |
| Session tracking, revocation, WS termination (≤30 s bound) | implemented |
| Live end-to-end verification against the canary | pending deployment |

## Frame policy

The dashboards own their embedding policy. `frontend-dashboard` and
`admin-dashboard` read `NEXT_PUBLIC_HEADMASTER_PARENT_ORIGIN` at **build
time** (Docker `ARG` → `ENV` → inlined into the Next.js build and
`next.config.ts` headers). With a valid exact HTTPS origin, every dashboard
response carries `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' <origin>`,
which supersedes the reverse proxy's `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` in modern
browsers. Without the variable, nothing is emitted and dashboards stay
same-origin-only. No nginx, Compose, or tunnel configuration changes are
required, and no wildcard or multi-origin embedding is possible.

## Launch exchange

1. The Headmaster page asks the embedded shell for a browser-binding nonce.
   The shell plants an HttpOnly, Secure, `SameSite=None; Partitioned` cookie
   (`hm_launch_browser`) via `POST /auth/headmaster/initiate` and returns the
   nonce over the origin-checked bridge.
2. The page posts the nonce to the Headmaster server
   (`POST /api/admin/nora/launch`), which freshly re-verifies the GCAP
   session, admin role, and suspension state, then issues a **single-use,
   ~60 s, origin- and audience-bound launch code** over an authenticated
   server-to-server call to Nora
   (`POST /api/internal/headmaster/launch-codes`, Bearer
   `HEADMASTER_S2S_TOKEN`). The code is stored atomically (`SET NX`, hashed)
   in Nora's Redis with the SHA-256 of the browser nonce.
3. The page hands the code to the shell, which redeems it
   (`POST /auth/headmaster/redeem`) with its binding cookie. Nora validates
   audience/origin, single use (`GETDEL`), browser binding, the **explicit**
   `headmaster_admin_links` row (GCAP account id → existing Nora admin;
   never the first admin, email alone, or metadata), and the linked user's
   current `admin` role — then issues a normal Nora session JWT flagged
   `hm: 1` and sets the native `nora_auth` cookie.

No service-role key, Nora API key, owner JWT, or long-lived session secret
ever reaches the browser, a URL, localStorage, or a postMessage payload. The
existing hello/status bridge messages remain presentation-only.

## Session lifecycle and revocation

Headmaster-launched sessions are tracked in Redis (`hm:sess:*`) and checked
on every authenticated request (`middleware/auth`); Redis outages fail
closed. Revocation paths:

- **GCAP logout / account switch** — the site calls
  `POST /api/internal/headmaster/revoke` with the GCAP session id.
- **GCAP suspension** — the site's suspend action revokes by GCAP user id.
- **Demotion (Nora side)** — role change to non-admin revokes immediately.
- **Link removal / user deletion** — revokes all sessions for the identity.
- **Bounded revalidation** — every active hm session is re-checked against
  the Headmaster session-check endpoint every
  `HEADMASTER_REVALIDATE_SECONDS` (≤30 s, default 25 s); dead GCAP sessions,
  lost roles, or bans revoke the Nora session. Revocation closes already-open
  privileged WebSockets (logs/terminal/metrics) immediately via Redis
  pub/sub, plus a per-socket re-check backstop.

Every issuance, redemption, rejection, and revocation is written to the
`headmaster_audit` table with the GCAP/Nora identity pair.

## Configuration

Nora backend (`/opt/nora/.env`):

- `HEADMASTER_S2S_TOKEN` — shared secret for the S2S surface (unset = the
  whole feature 404s).
- `HEADMASTER_PARENT_ORIGIN` — exact HTTPS origin of the Headmaster host.
- `HEADMASTER_SESSION_CHECK_URL` — Headmaster's session-check endpoint.
- `HEADMASTER_LAUNCH_TTL_SECONDS` (default 60), `HEADMASTER_REVALIDATE_SECONDS`
  (default 25, max 30).

Nora frontend builds (both dashboards): `NEXT_PUBLIC_HEADMASTER_PARENT_ORIGIN`
build arg — must equal `HEADMASTER_PARENT_ORIGIN`.

Headmaster site: `HEADMASTER_NORA_EMBED_ENABLED` (default off),
`HEADMASTER_NORA_ORIGIN` (default `https://nora.gcaplabs.com`),
`HEADMASTER_NORA_S2S_TOKEN` (same secret as Nora).

Identity links are provisioned explicitly (never inferred):

```
POST /api/internal/headmaster/admin-links   (S2S bearer)
{ "gcapUserId": "<supabase user id>", "noraUserId": "<existing Nora admin uuid>" }
```

## Deployment and rollback

Build only the affected images (backend-api, frontend-dashboard,
admin-dashboard) from this branch and recreate those services; workers,
Postgres, Redis, volumes, and the agent network are untouched. Rollback =
redeploy the previous image tags and/or point the frontends back at the
previous build; disabling `HEADMASTER_NORA_EMBED_ENABLED` restores the
classic `/admin`. Native Nora login at the marketing site remains the
break-glass operator path throughout.
